# TeloReport

TeloPort / TeloReport is a collection of tools for extracting and clustering subtelomeric sequences from raw reads.

## About

Subtelomeres are often studied because they undergo frequent rearrangements. However, due to the repeating nature of telomeres, many reads containing valuable subtelomere information are difficult to place in the genome assembly. This project was created as a means of extracting and processing subtelomeric reads from raw read datasets for the purposes of analysis and for more accurate construction of subtelomeric regions in fully assembled genomes.

This project was developed in collaboration with Trey Stansfield (WKU) and the following mentors:

* UKY:  [Dr. Jerzy Jaromczyk](https://www.engr.uky.edu/directory/jaromczyk-jerzy)
  * [Dr. Mark Farman](https://plantpathology.ca.uky.edu/person/mark-farman)
* EKU:  [Dr. Patrick Calie](https://biology.eku.edu/people/calie)
* WKU:  [Dr. Claire Rinehart](https://www.wku.edu/biology/staff/claire_rinehart)
