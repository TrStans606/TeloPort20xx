# TeloReport
TeloPort / TeloReport is a collection of tools for extracting and clustering subtelomeric sequences from raw reads.

## About

Subtelomeres are often studied because they undergo frequent rearrangements. This project was created as a means of extracting and processing subtelomeres for the purposes of analysis and for more accurate construction of subtelomeric regions in fully assembled genomes.

Created in collaboration with Trey Stansfield (WKU) and the following mentors:
  UKY:  [Dr. Jerzy Jaromczyk]https://www.engr.uky.edu/directory/jaromczyk-jerzy
